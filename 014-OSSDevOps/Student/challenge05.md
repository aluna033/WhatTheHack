### Introduction

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. [Reference](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)

### Challenge

Develop a set of unit tests for the voting application. Since this application is written in Python, use pythons Unit testing framework [**unittest**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
   

### Success Criteria
